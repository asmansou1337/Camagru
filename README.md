# CamagruProject

This web project is a web application allowing to make basic photo and video editing using a webcam and some predefined images.

**User features**
• The application should allow a user to sign up by asking at least a valid email address, an username and a password with at least a minimum level of complexity.
• At the end of the registration process, the user should confirm his account via a unique link sent at the email address fullfiled in the registration form.
• The user should then be able to connect to your application, using his username and his password. He also should be able to tell the application to send a password reinitialisation mail, if he forget his password.
• The user should be able to disconnect in one click at any time on any page.
• Once connected, an user should modify his username, mail address or password.

**Gallery features**
• This part is to be public and must display all the images edited by all the users, ordered by date of creation. It should also allow (only) a connected user to like
them and/or comment them.
• When an image receives a new comment, the author of the image should be notified by email. This preference must be set as true by default but can be deactivated in
user’s preferences.
• The list of images must be paginated, with at least 5 elements per page.

**Editing features**
This page should contain 2 sections:
• A main section containing the preview of the user’s webcam, the list of superposable images and a button allowing to capture a picture.
• A side section displaying thumbnails of all previous pictures taken.
